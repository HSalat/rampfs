# A guide to data science in Rust

I'm thinking of writing up common problems/solutions that come up in data science piplines. Just notes so far.

Ideally this'll be multi-language; the same principles often apply everywhere

## Determinism

hashmaps, RNG seeds, pinning to software versions, pinning to data versions like OSM extracts

## Floating points

- sorting, rounding, serializing

## Good error messages

- Rust specific: No such file or directory, use fs-err

## ID wrapper types
